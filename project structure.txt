features
main!
- select source encoding, target encoding, file or folder
-> convert encoding of all files within folder to target encoding
- specify file by: 
	- file extension(by default only txt files, can change to accept all, or specific), 
	or multiple extensions, select without '.' warning when changing from default txt
	can damage other files(image)
	- checkbox hidden files
	- regex script(display example)
	- specify target folder/or make copy next to source folder(convertingwithjava - copy)
- working with io for now, might replace with nio later with research, try using foreach
	learn about recursion

- detect encoding -> display sample text(first file, display file name)
 and ask weather to use this charset
- check if specific charset supported by this program
- display text of several encoding as list(default charsets, choose others if needed)
 	- can select manual sample size, select certain file

-add BOM, display information about BOM
	- check if bom already there, can add or remove

additional:
- change file extensions
- rename using regex(later)
- files containing certain characters
- move
- line operators? need to research more later
- etc

GUI
- semantic version control
- github link, about
- dropdown menu of basic charsets, select by language?
- using java swing, maybe practice javafx later
- select files by dragging

Questions
- charsetDecoder.isAutodetected(): if implementing auto-detecting charset, what is auto
detecting charset
-path.relativize


Final
check if file has extension or not
check access modifiers
