- select source encoding, target encoding, file or folder
-> convert encoding of all files within folder to target encoding
- specify file by: 
	- file extension(by default only txt files, can change to accept all, or specific), or multiple extensions
	- checkbox hidden files
	- regex script(display example)
- working with io for now, might replace with nio later with research, try using foreach

- detect encoding -> display sample text(first file, display file name)
 and ask weather to use this charset
- check if specific charset supported by this program
- display text of several encoding as list(default charsets, choose others if needed)
 	- can select manual sample size, select certain file

-add BOM, display information about BOM
	- check if bom already there, can add or remove

additional:
- change file extensions
- rename using regex(later)
- line operators? need to research more later
